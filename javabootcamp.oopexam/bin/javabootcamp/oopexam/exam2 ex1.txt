1. Objects are known as Instances in java, an instance is a representation of a class. In practice the instance is used to point about one particular object.
2. Static binding is resolved at compile time, whether the dynamic is at run time.
3. Association is a dependency that contains a reference to an object.
Aggregation is association which have a class that shared by the object.
Composestion is when there is a hard dependency to another class and it cant run without it.
4. No, overrigind is based on the dynamic binding at runtime, but static method are bonded to use static binding which occurs at the compile time.
